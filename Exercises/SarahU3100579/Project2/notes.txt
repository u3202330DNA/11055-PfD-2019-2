Your prototype will read a provided file that contains a list of book isbn numbers. 
Using python, it will then generate a html page(s) that displays information about the books in a format of your choosing.

Assessment criteria
-Creativity of approach.
-Application of appropriate programming concepts.
-Quality and clarity of the code, including formatting and consistency.
-Visual presentation and communication.
-Ability to explain your approach (demonstrated through a flow chart, pseudocode, comments in your code and a final reflection on the work).



REMEMBER THE FLOW CHART AND PSEUDOCODE ARE ABOUT 1/2 THE MARKS 
is it creative? or have you just done the bare minimum? or the same as everybody else?
have you correctly applied the thing's we've been learning in class?
is your code done well, correctly, no errors, clear formatting?
is it well presented? have you used css and good presentation/communication?
have you explained your approach with comments, flow chart, pseudocode? does your flow chart and pseudocode match your programming?




a dialog box to find the file 
read the file (using error code) 
display basic info well presented on main page. with some css 
an accurate and detailed flowchart and pseudocode
detailed comments explaining the work 


can i do something fancy with css like have a detailed sort of info but have collapsable sections so it's all on the one page.?
use different page? 
use error coding 




json is built in? so i can use open library? 
they have url base. which you type in i think. 
https://openlibrary.org/api/books?bibkeys=ISBN:0451526538&callback=mycallback"> 
see https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/books 
baseurl= 'https://openlibrary.org/api/books?bibkeys=ISBN:' 
isbn number 

format, since i need it in json so 
formaturl= &format=json
datatypeurl=& (jscmd=viewapi, or jscmd=data, or?? jscmd=details)

so like the whole url that i need for a thing is [baseurl + isbn + formaturl + datatypeurl]

this returns the information, and then we select what bits of info we want to show i think. using like 'title'or something?? 
see maybe this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxofwuWTs7c 
i think he like saved this all in funciton. so was this what simon was talking about? 


Thanks Lord! now i feel slightly less panicked.. but still a lot to do. 


define a range of numbers e.g. 0-199? 
while range <200 
do the loop 
Loop stuff 
at end of loop add 1 to range... 

is that what this is?? 
		def read_lines(filename,lines): # they defined a function
		k=''
		f=open(filename,'r')
		for line in range(lines):
		k+=(f.readline())
		return k

		print(read_lines('test.txt',2)) 

so, i'm not sure what do to with the loop thing. i've got in red. since it's messy

Try to read the file 
if that doesn't work display error 
read up to 100 lines in the file. 

read up to 100 lines in the isbn file 
Line number < 100





json should be standard?


or?

create class
find file 
open file 
create html and css
read file lines
record file lines in class/array

get the lines 
put them as objects in a class 

but i can only display the info an a page. i can do nothing else. 
for each object in the class, create a page with the info?






i have to open a file of numbers. 
Locate file 
Open file 
Read file lines 
And for each line i have to collect a bunch of in
Basically i'm not sure if I want to use classes or objects or whaterver somehow. i might have to look up some tutorials. 

What would i like to do, 
create a main page, with some basic info. and then an idvidual page for them, but on click... or something. 

desicions
loops
files 
errors 
classes and objects
use multiplie python files and import -at least with the classes??

so, i open the file. 
I read the numbers 
I look up the number/collect the right info 
I compile the information (into an object) 
I put the information into a file in their objects. 



so, how do i do that. 


open files
create all the html bits as variables so you just plug them together
all the fetching of the info is a link. it just links to the info.
so how do i put info into a object when it's just linked??
don't forget to close files 

if i'm creating an object like so.. after it has been defined 
p1 = Person("John", 36)
where e.g. 
Book1 = Book(value for property, value for property)


things to add to the flowchart, (errors etc.)
Can file be found?
Can you read the file?
Can you find the info?
etc.


class Book:
	def __init__(self, title, author, isbn, subject, cover, publisher, year):
	self.title = title 
	self.author = author
	self.isbn = isbn
	self.subject = subject
	self.cover = cover
	self.publisher = publisher
	self.year = year

b1 = Book()
print(b1.title)

or maybe that is far too complicated. i'll have to look up objects and things. 












so what i want to do with the loop is something like 

-> Read the file 
loop 
read line 
record line 
input the 

read lines up to 100

if number of lines is over 100 - but i can't check before hand, unless i get them to input and there's not much poiny 
but i could go read 100 lines, 
like just repeat, but there's not much point. because i can't check, so 


check the number of lines 
if number of lines is over 100 
then record only the first 100 
OR
record all number of lines. 
then only inser the first 100 into a html file... 

Or I could just show all of them. 

Might have discovered a thing called slicing.. which might work https://www.pythoncentral.io/how-to-slice-listsarrays-and-tuples-in-python/ 
THIS 
Or instead, you can use readlines() and then slice:

text_file = open(file_to_save, "r")
lines = text_file.readlines()
lines = lines[19:52] 
which reads lines 20-52
since thet start at zero.. it's weird, but should work. 
So i can't really count the number of lines but i can slice them... 

So i can go 
Read file up to 100 lines 
read lines [0:100] etc. still not entirely sure how to flow chart that thought


there is a thing called enumerate 
https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_enumerate.asp 
which literally count the number of things... 

count the number of lines (https://www.sanfoundry.com/python-program-count-lines-text-file/)
	IF number of lines is less than 100 THEN
		DO 
		read line
		record line 
		input line into html file 
		LOOP
	ELSE (More than 100)
	DO 
	read lines up to 100
	record lines
	input line into html file 
	LOOP

I mean i could just try to read only up to 100, but if there are less than 100 does it break it? 
Haven't tried. I mean it should work?? in theory? And it;s certaintly going to make your flow chart more complicated... but i haven't even figured out how to do the actual getting the info yet, i have so much to do.
