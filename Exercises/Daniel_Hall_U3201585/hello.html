<h1 style = "color:#ffffff";>Ezekiel 25:17</h1>
<p style = "color:#ffffff";>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the
        Inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men 
        Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will 
        shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness 
        for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children 
        And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious
        Anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers 
        And you will know
        My name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee.</p>
