define variables, etc here. Background picture has to be defined - bg;

function setup() {
      createCanvas(width and height of picture reference);
      bg = (/images/picture of me.jpg);
      background( a picture of me); this line will be commented out as it is a reference
      Although it is just a reference, it's there to not only show coding skill, but is
      a comparison almost.

      I also wanna add a function that changes the eye colour.
      I'd have to define eye colour before saying what eye colour will be. - eyecolour;
      eyecolour = (RGB); Maybe randomised on click?

}

function draw() {

      line(x1,y1,x2,y2);  For who knows how many lines
      
      Maybe ellipses for the eyes and pupils
      ellipse(x,y,w,h);  X4 with 2 being a size at least a half or less than the other 2
      
      Text(If I'm to have the eyes change colour on click then I might wanna let the user
      know); As I've seen so far I can put textSize in any place.
}      

function for mouse click to change eye colour-mousePressed?() {
      I could set it up so that the user has to click the eyes or just anywhere in 
      browser.
      eyecolour = (RGB);
}
