PROJECT 2 _ APPEND BOOK INFORMATION TO HTML PAGE USING OPENLIBRARY API IN PYTHON
    - PSEUDOCODE -
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

import the class 'bookclass' as bc.
import urllib.request as rq and json to retrieve data from openlibrary API.

Write a new html file and name it 'bookpage.html' and open the 'ISBN.txt' file as a read file.

Create HTML tags inside 'bookpage.html' (file2) to hold API data retrieved from openlibrary API.

Create a variable called 'array' that reads file1 (ISBN.txt). 

Create an empty variable called 'array1' :
For the isbn in the variable array, append the variable "array1" and the class "bc" and book to it.
    Inside curved brackets,add isbn and three other placeholder characters to append the ISBN.txt contents too.
    for file2, write an image tag in curved brackets and append isbn to show book covers.

    Create a variable called gbook containing the urllib request imported at the beginning of the program.
        Write bookcovers to 'bookpage.html' in an image tag. Insert image url after '<img src =' . 
            Inside the gbook variable, open a openlibrary url that requests data from the openlibrary API for the bookcover image.
            Run the isbn file (ISBN.txt) through the url by adding + isbn + after 'isbn/' and before '-L.jpg' in the image tag.

    Create a variable called 'bk' that loads the gbook url using a json request.
    Create another variable named 'bid' containing the string, 'ISBN:'
        Add an isbn.strip that returns a copy of the 'ISBN:' string.
        Write new data to 'file2' that contains 'bk' and 'bid' variable and reads the API    data retrieved from the OpenLibrary API.
        Locate and add data from the API (e.g. 'title') and write them to 'file2'  on separate lines. 
 

Close 'bookpage.html', 'file1' and 'file2'.
