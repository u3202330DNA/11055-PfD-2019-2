For this assignment, I start to do the flow chart at first as I realise it is important to think about the structure before actually do the code. 
And for the code, I have been using While loop and for loop to create the program. I made while as a start and put the rest of the code inside the while loop, so that the program can keep receive the new file and running until it told to be stopped. Then I used google API to search for the information of the book and using open library to search for the image. For loop is used to keep reading all the number on the file until there is no number left, then for loop will end and the file html will start to run and generate on the browser. I used the if statement to end the program if needed. 
I also put the whole program into error handling, so that the error can handle by printing a message to inform errors, and it does not affect to the whole program running in total. 
In my case, because sometime the API google take a while to search and the program will put it as connection error.
