filename = open("ISBN.txt", "rt")

for xlines in filename:
     print(xlines[0])? - display one line at a time to keep as a variable

html = open("webpage containing links to other webpages.html", "a")

variable list for html code and links

html.write(variable + xlines[0] + another variable containing link to a website containing book info)

html.write(variable + xlines[1] + another variable containing link to a website containing book info)

html.close()   - Don't need it opened if were opening in web browser right?

import webbrowser
webbrowser.open(webpage containing links to other webpages.html)?

And then that should open a html page which should display IBSN numbers next to related links.
E.g

Line one of ISBN.txt - Link to website
Line two of ISBN.txt - Link to different website
