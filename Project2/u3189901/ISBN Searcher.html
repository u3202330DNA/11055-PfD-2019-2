Once, a hero rose to save the world. He failed. For a thousand years since, the world has been a wasteland of ash and mist ruled by the immortal emperor known as the Lord Ruler. Every revolt has failed miserably. Yet somehow, hope survives. Hope that dares to dream of ending the empire and defeating the Lord Ruler. A new kind of uprising is being planned—one that depends on the cunning of a brilliant criminal mastermind and the determination of an unlikely heroine: a teenage street urchin named Vin. Once, a hero rose to save the world and failed. This time, can a young heroine succeed?</p><p>Public Domain:False</p><p>Page count:672</p><p>Language:en</p><p>***</p><h1>Title:&nbspWarbreaker</h1><img src='http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3Cjz7DKv74MC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'.jpg<br><h2>Summary:</h2><p>Author(s): Brandon Sanderson</p><p>Synopsis: Warbreaker is the story of two sisters - who happen to be princesses, the God King one of them has to marry, a lesser god, and an immortal trying to undo the mistakes he made hundreds of years ago. Theirs is a world in which those who die in glory return as gods to live confined to a pantheon in Hallandren's capital city. A world transformed by BioChromatic magic, a power based on an essence known as breath. Using magic is arduous: breath can only be collected one unit at a time from individual people. But the rewards are great: by using breath and drawing upon the color in everyday objects, all manner of miracles and mischief can be performed. Brandon Sanderson proves again that he is a master of what Tolkien called 'secondary creation,' the invention of whole worlds, complete with magics and myths all their own.</p><p>Public Domain:False</p><p>Page count:688</p><p>Language:en</p><p>***</p><h1>Title:&nbspElantris</h1><img src='http://books.google.com/books/content?id=R_nt5CFaJKEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'.jpg<br><h2>Summary:</h2><p>Author(s): Brandon Sanderson</p><p>Synopsis: Elantris was built on magic and it thrived.
